# OpenGL Practice
This repository contains OpenGL code for learning computer graphics.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project on an **Apple Silicon-based macOS**, you need to install several dependencies such as `Homebrew`, `cmake`, and OpenGL-related libraries like `GLEW`, `GLM`, and `FreeGLUT`. Follow the steps below to set up your development environment.

### 1. Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of necessary libraries.

If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, open the Terminal and run the following command:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, ensure itâ€™s working by running:

```sh
brew --version
```

### 2. Install CMake

CMake is a tool that manages the build process of the project.

Install CMake using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install cmake
```

### 3. Install OpenGL-related Libraries

Next, you need to install the required OpenGL libraries: GLEW, GLM, and FreeGLUT. Run the following commands to install these libraries:

```sh
brew install glew glm freeglut
```

## How to Build and Run the Project?

Once all the prerequisites are installed, follow these steps to build and run the project:

### 1. Configure and Build the Project

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following commands to configure and build the project:

```sh
# Configure the project with CMake and create the build directory
cmake -S . -B build

# Build the project inside the build directory
make -C build
```

### 2. Run the Executable

After the build completes, run the generated executable to launch the OpenGL application:

```sh
./build/OpenGLProject
```

This will open the OpenGL window, running the main.cpp or other source files defined in the project.
